            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Peter Thiel’s Zero to One feels like a conversation with someone who wants you to slow down, think
                differently, and question everything you assume about startups. Instead of giving
                checklist-style advice, Thiel pushes readers to look at the world with fresh eyes and ask: What can I
                create that doesn’t already exist?

                That’s the heart of the book: <i>moving from zero to one</i>, creating something entirely new rather
                than incrementally adding to what already exists.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Why “Zero to One”</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Thiel explains that there are two kinds of progress. One is copying
                what already works. That’s how we get more restaurants, more apps, more products that look and feel the
                same. This kind of progress is easy to understand, and it keeps the world moving, but it doesn’t really
                change it.

                The other type is true innovation. It’s when someone invents something so new that the world becomes
                different afterward. Think of the first computers, the first smartphones, or the first social networks.
                These ideas didn’t come from improving what already existed, they came from someone seeing a possibility
                that others missed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                One of the most interesting ideas in the book is Thiel’s belief that the world still holds “secrets”,
                important ideas or opportunities that most people don’t notice. He believes that great founders succeed
                because they discover one of these secrets.

                He encourages us to ask questions like:

                What problem do people have that nobody is solving?

                What do I believe that most people don’t?

                These questions sound simple, but they push us to look for hidden opportunities. Many breakthrough
                companies were built this way. They didn’t win because they were louder or faster, they won because they
                saw something others ignored.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Startups are about people, not just ideas</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Thiel also talks about how great companies are built by tight, committed teams. The best startups feel
                like groups of people who believe strongly in a shared mission, not just coworkers collecting a
                paycheck. They trust each other, they know their roles, and they push toward the same goal.

                He also believes that strong founders matter. Not because they’re perfect, but because they have a clear
                vision and the courage to stick with it, even when others doubt them.
