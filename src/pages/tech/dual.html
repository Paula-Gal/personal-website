            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Technology has always carried dual potential, which is the power to uplift society and the possibility of being used in ways its creators maybe never intended. Today, as innovation accelerates, dual-use tech tools that can serve both civilian and defense purposes sits at the center of some of the most important conversations in global innovation.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Dual-use technologies are everywhere. Artificial intelligence helps doctors detect diseases earlier, but the same algorithms can optimize cyberattacks. Drones deliver medical supplies to remote regions, yet they can also be repurposed for surveillance or conflict. Even everyday tools like GPS and the internet began as military technologies before transforming into global infrastructure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                What makes dual-use tech so influential is its ability to scale impact across sectors. A breakthrough in robotics might streamline disaster response, manufacturing, and agriculture all at once. Advances in biotech can fuel new therapies while improving food production. And AI-driven analytics can empower both humanitarian aid and smart logistics systems.
