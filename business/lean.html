                When you’re building a new product or company, it’s easy to feel like you’re guessing your way through the dark. You have ideas, plans, excitement, but what you don’t have is certainty. The Lean Startup by Eric Ries speaks directly to that feeling. Instead of pretending founders know everything upfront, the book offers a simple truth: you won’t know if your idea works until you see how real people react to it.

                Ries doesn’t promise shortcuts or magic formulas. What he offers is a practical way to move forward even when things are uncertain, by testing small, learning quickly, and letting customers guide you before you’ve spent months building something they never asked for.

            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The book is all about reducing risk, speeding up learning, and avoiding the biggest startup trap, creating something nobody wants.<br>

                <br>The Core Idea: Build → Measure → Learn

                Ries introduces a simple but powerful loop:<br>

                <br>Build – create something small, fast<br>

                Measure – see how customers respond<br>

                Learn – decide what to change, improve, or stop<br>

                <br>This cycle repeats constantly. It replaces long business plans with real-world feedback. Instead of guessing what people might like, you learn what they actually do.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Minimum Viable Product</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                One of the most famous ideas from the book is the MVP.

                An MVP is not the perfect version of your idea. It’s the smallest, simplest version that lets you learn something. This might be:

                a basic prototype

                a landing page

                a simple app with one feature

                even a video demonstrating the idea

                The point isn’t to impress people. The point is to test your assumptions quickly.

                Ries says too many founders waste time building features customers don’t care about. An MVP helps you find out what matters before you spend months (or years) building the wrong thing.

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Validated learning</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Another big concept is validated learning. It means you don’t rely on opinions, assumptions, or “gut feelings.” You learn from real data collected from real customers.

                Examples:

                Do people click?

                Do they sign up?

                Do they return?

                Do they pay?

                These are the truths that guide a startup. When you measure real customer behavior, you learn what’s working and what isn’t.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Pivot</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Every startup reaches a point where it must make a crucial decision:

                Keep going with the original idea (persevere), or

                Make a major change in direction (pivot)

                A pivot isn’t starting over. It’s adjusting your product or business model based on what you learned.

                Examples of pivots:

                changing your target customer

                focusing on a different feature

                switching from paid to free, or vice versa

                changing how the product is delivered

                Instagram is a famous example. It started as a complicated check-in app with many features. When the founders saw people only used the photo filters, they pivoted—and the rest is history.<br>
                The Lean Startup isn’t about building faster—it’s about learning faster. It’s a reminder that building a business isn’t about guessing. It’s about discovering. When you listen to customers, test small, and stay adaptable, you dramatically increase your chances of creating something people truly want.

                In simple terms: build smart, not big.
